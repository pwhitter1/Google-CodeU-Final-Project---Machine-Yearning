This is our search engine final project for the Google CodeU program.

It features Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, live search suggestions, a quick search button, a spell check feature, and keyword specification (AND, OR, MINUS).

We hosted our search engine on the Apache Tomcat web server and used Java Server Pages to communicate between fronted and backend.

We indexed the top 15 most frequently viewed Wikipedia pages within a specific one-week period in July, which happened to coincide with the Republican National Convention.

See our uploaded presentation for more information.
