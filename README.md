\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is our search engine final project for the Google CodeU program.\
\
It features Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, live search suggestions, a quick search button, a spell check feature, and keyword specification (AND, OR, MINUS).\
\
We hosted our search engine on the Apache Tomcat web server and used Java Server Pages to communicate between fronted and backend.\
\
We indexed the top 15 most frequently viewed Wikipedia pages within a specific one-week period in July, which happened to coincide with the Republican National Convention.\
\
See our uploaded presentation for more information.\
