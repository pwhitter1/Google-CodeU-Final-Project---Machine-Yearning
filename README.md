This is our final project for the Google CodeU program, a search engine.

It features term frequency-inverse document frequency ranking, stop word search prevention, live search suggestions, a spell check feature, a quick search button, and keyword specification (AND, OR, MINUS).

We indexed the top 15 most frequently viewed Wikipedia pages between 07/17/16 - 07/24/16, which coincided coincidentally with the Republican National Convention. We used the Apache Tomcat web server to host our webpage and Java Server Pages to communicate between fronted and backend.

See our uploaded presentation for more information.
